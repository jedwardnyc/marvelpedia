# Marvelpedia

Made in conjunction with Fullstack Academy's Stackathon 48hr hackathon. This whole app was built within a span of two class periods (I came back and cleaned it up a little bit later).

## Utilizing Marvel's API to make calls to their extensive comic database and filtered that info encyclopedia style. It also uses Google's Cloud Vision API to identify characters in photos that can are encoded to base64 and sent directly to Google without the need for storing photos in a database.
